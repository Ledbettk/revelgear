	<h2>Get Out For Good</h2>
	<p>We hold the radical belief that doing business with integrity has the power to change the world. Post a photo on Social Media with #RevelGear and for every post, we will send 1 light to Africa through our partnership with the <a href="http://www.ccaeunited.org/" target="_blank"><i>Colorado Coalition for African Empowerment</i></a> </p>

	<p>We are on our way to reaching our goal of sending 1,000,000 lights to Africa, but we need your help. To learn more about how you can become a distribution partner, <a href="contact.html"><i> Contact Us </i></a> for more information</p>

		<img class="lightimg" src="images/africa_1.jpg" alt="Africa image 1">
	</div>

	<p class="csr_text"> Access to energy is essential to reduce poverty. In Africa alone, there are 2x as many people as the United States, Mexico and Canada combined who still don’t have access to electricity.  In fact, there are more people living today without lights than when Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb!</p>

	<h2 class="productH2">Reduce Carbon Emissions</h2>
	<img class="lightimg" src="images/africa_2.jpg" alt="Africa image 2">
	</div>

	<p class="csr_text"> Each solar light shining means one less kerosene lamp in the world, or around 441 pounds less carbon dioxide per year. This means one less person breathing in carbon dioxide while trying to read a book and one less person exasperating the current global warming situation.  We think it’s a no brainer, do you agree? </p>

	<h2 class="productH2">More Than Just Lights</h2>
	<img class="lightimg" src="images/africa_3.jpg" alt="Africa image 3">
	</div>

	<p class="csr_text"> It’s about more than just lights. Mobile phones keep people in touch with family and friends, and give access to information, entertainment and mobile money. Being able to charge a mobile phone with a solar home system is an added advantage. Solar power enables people in off-grid homes to stay connected to the world, without the cost and effort of sending phones to be charged in far off towns. </p>

<h2>The CCAE</h2>

<p> The Colorado Coalition for African Empowerment is comprised of twelve Colorado registered non-profits that are scaling up based on their collective successful empowerment projects in nineteen African countries. CCAE was introduced in 2010.
The Coalition strives to empower impoverished sub-Saharan African families and orphaned children by creating holistic and sustainable projects that result in self-support through collaborative fund-raising and grant efforts.</p>
